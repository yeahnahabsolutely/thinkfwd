The journey began on the 16th of October with me arriving in Athens after 7 months of travelling through some parts of South East Asia.
Having terminated my work agreement couple days before, I have received a well needed rest, during which I was contemplating on what to do next.
As I was walking the rather hypnotic streets of Athens in the corner of my eye I spotted a bicycle shop. This reminded me of a guy that took part in a journey through the U.K. just with his tent and a bicycle.
After a couple of days of hesitation, I have bought a bicycle, and so it began a "bikepacking" journey from Athens to Sofia. 

Granted, a day before heading out into the wilderness of Greece, I met a group of bike travellers in the hostel I was staying in so I was not going into it all blind.

Rest of the story is still wip..
