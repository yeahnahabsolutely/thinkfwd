The journey began on the 16th of October, after travelling for 7 months mainly through Indonesia and Sri lanka I arrived in Athens.
My mind was set on physical exercise, having worked for over two years with barely any holidays I was looking for a change of pace.
As I was walking through the ancient streets of Athens in the corner of my eye I spotted a bicycle shop, not long after here I was with my mind set on bicycling from Athens to Sofia. 

Granted, a day before heading out into the wilderness of Greece, I met a group of bike travellers in the hostel I was staying in so I was not going into it all blind.

Here's a picture of the very first day, just outside Athens.
