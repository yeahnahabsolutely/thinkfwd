It is 13th of October, early morning, here I am pushing my bicycle through the hostel doors to begin my first cycling journey.
I am in Athens, the sun is beginning it's morning climb, the sky is clear blue. My bike is a lot heavier than usual. I am in doubt knowing the mountainous terrain ahead.
*I inhale slowly*, haven't done anything like that before. *Smile to self*. I begin cycling. 

60 kms to a campsite. Starting small. Destination [Nea Makri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nea_Makri).
The cars are whizzing by my shoulder. Mind is occupied by the beauty of my surroundings. Every climb is rewarded with a down climb. Overwhelming sense of freedom.

Couple hours later, I am at the campsite. It is empty.
I am greeted by the owner who is suprised to see a visitor at this point in time.
We talk bicycles. I don't know much about bicycles. A little later I am shown my patch of grass. I ask for the direction to the sea. I unpack my bags, setup my tent clumsily. 
My legs are tired. I walk to the beach.

The next day I promise to cycle further. I feel strong, my legs don't. 
The time it takes to pack, shower and get going is longer than I thought.
No time to wander around, 11 hours of sunglight left. Headed to [Chalcis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcis), 6 hours of cycling (or so I thought).
I pack 3.5L of water, two laptops. Bike is wobbling. Headed for the hills. 

3 hours in the hardest climb is seemingly done. Here is [Marathon dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_Dam).
It's beautiful here, huge dam, clear blue sky, bird singing their song. 
I am damn slow today. A little worried. Only a quarter of distance covered. **5 hours left**.

Next 3 hours is just hills, dirt roads and heavy breathing.
Eventually I could see the end of those hills. I reach the sea. That's half way. **2 hours of sunlight left**.

I decide to get something to eat. I look near homeless and I am, for now.
The heat is killing. I am starving. *One greek salad please*. I go for a swim.
While swimming I strike a conversation with another fellow mid-day, mid-week, offseason, empty beach swimmer.
We talk life, ambitions and dreams. Feel inspired.

Time is not on my side. Around 1 hour of sunlight left. I begin cycling again, a little faster this time.

It is **20:05**. I am at the gas station, just outside Chalcis, asking for places to camp. Most of the beaches have high tide and are unsafe to camp in.
Given the directions, I begin cycling the small roads of an otherwise busy holiday destination. 
No light around outside of my head torch. Sounds of dogs barking in the distance. The wind is strong, you could feel the sea nearing in. I head towards the sea.
Eventually I find a spot. Here I am in the dark, setting up my tent.
The otherwise welcoming sea is scary now. I wonder if I should lock my bike. I lay down in my tent, wind is howling. I close my eyes.

**7:00**, time to get up. The sun is barely showing on the horizon. 
Anxious to leave. I pack fast this time. I follow the coast, no more mountains. Not today.
Green grass, orange trees, hills, dirt roads and small villages. Not a single car in sight, not a worry in my mind. Shouting, laughing.
I reach the village. A couple beers. Time to sleep.

Three days in. It is time to rest. Looks like it is going to rain today. Look around for campsites near. There is a couple.
Wrap my bags, drink some coffee. I take off.


I follow the coast. Ocassional swim. First campsite is closed, cycle to another. Additional 20kms. It is flat here, cycling is easy in the flats.
What a breeze. I reach campsite [Venezuela](https://venezuela.gr/). Big salad, pork steak, a couple beers. Life is great.
