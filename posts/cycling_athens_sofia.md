It is 13th of October, early morning, here I am pushing my bicycle through the hostel doors to begin my first cycling journey.
I am in Athens, the sun is beginning it's morning climb, the sky is clear blue. My bike is a lot heavier than usual. I am in doubt knowing the mountainous terrain ahead.
*I inhale slowly*, haven't done anything like that before. *Smile to self*. I begin cycling. 

Starting small, 60 kilometers to a campsite in [Nea Makri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nea_Makri).
The cars are whizzing by my shoulder. Mind is occupied by the beauty of my surroundings. Every climb is rewarded by a temporary decline. Overwhelming sense of freedom.

Time goes by, I am at the campsite. It is completely empty.
I am shown my patch of grass, the outside shower and the direction to the sea. I unpack my bags, setup my tent clumsily. 
My legs are tired. I decide to walk to the beach, mind is set on food and the sea.

The next day I am sore. No clear plan in mind, need to get over these mountains and head towards [Chalcis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcis).
First realisation is the time it takes to pack your tent, eat breakfast and get going. So much of the time is swallowed by this routine. 6 hours of cycling. 11 hours of sunglight left.
We take off.

3 hours in I arrive to the [Marathon dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_Dam). Conditions are clear, the hardest incline is seemingly done.
Quarter of a distance covered, komoot shows 5 hours left. My pace is slow and all I can see is dirtroads ahead of me. No life in sight, just fields and mountains.
No need to worry I tell myself. *Just keep cycling*.

Next 3 hours were mostly steep inclines followed by short declines with patches of dirt road now and then.
Eventually I reach the sea. [link to sea pic]. *That's halfway*. 

Time is 16:45 there is an hour of sunlight left. Need to find a place to camp at.
I understand I will likely cycle in the dark, what a rush.

It is <b>20:05</b> I am at the gas station asking for places to camp as most of the beaches have high tide and are unsafe to camp in.
Given the directions, I begin cycling the small roads of an otherwise busy holiday destination. The only light there is is one of my head torch.
There is olive trees all around and sounds of dogs barking. The wind is strong, you could feel the sea nearing in. I head towards the sea.
Eventually I find a patch of grass for my tent. Here I am in the dark, setting up my tent.
The otherwise welcoming sea is scary in that moment. I wonder if I should lock my bike. *What am I even doing here*.

This day I wake up before the sun. The sky is clear red. [morning picture]
I am anxious to leave. The morning routine does not take so long.
